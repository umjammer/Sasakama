Sasakama is a speech synthesis engine based on HMM.
Sasakama is implemented by Java.
Thanks to HTS Working Group, speech synthesis can be used easier.

## How to synthesize
To synthesize speech with Sasakama, you must prepare speech model HMM (HTS voice) and full context format label.
If you want to synthesize speech easily, please use "Gyutan".
Gyutan can synthesize speech with HTS voice and text that you want to synthesize.
But Gyutan can synthesize Japanese speech only.

please see Gyutan repository.
